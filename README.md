# Parasite Meta 
Welcome to the Parasite Meta GitHub Repository! This is where you can **report bugs** and **suggest features** for Parasite! 

Parasite Developers will be using this along with our private Trello to try and fix bugs as quickly as posible, along with getting the communities input on new features. Any questions about *this* GitHub Repository should go to @Riley#9202 and/or @RichieNy#0002

## General Information
<hr>

This is what our Developers will be using to take bug reports. All of our code is in GitHub so this seems like the best aproch to bug squashing. We will be using the GitHub issue tracker to help go through bugs/features.

We understand you might not have much experience using GitHub, and that's fine! We'll do our best to help you navigate this tracker. We can start by introducing some key terms you'll be hearing a lot:
* **Issue:** A feature request or bug report.
* **Repository** *(repo)***:** Refers to the group of Parsite Meta pages. Includes the issue tracker and documents (like this one).
* **Bug:** Any piece of unintended behaviour anywhere on Parasite. Basically, if something isn't working how it should, it's a bug.
* **Valid:** If an issue is correct. Reproducible? Correct information? Actually an issue?
* **Invalid:** If an issue is incorrect, or if the format is not followed.
* **Reproducible:** If a bug report can be copied or induced by other people. A bug report must be **reproducible** to be valid.

Now that you're an expert on the technical jargon we use to manage issues, you're one step closer to making your first issue!

## Community Expectations
<hr>

We expect members of the community participating in conversations here to act in a civil manner and to keep this forum productive and enjoyable. Users who break rules will have their messages deleted and they may be permanently banned from participating depending on the circumstances.

### Do:
* Use the issue templates provided
* Help out staff if asked
* Contribute to on-going discussions
* Give constructive feedback to ideas
* Search the [issue](https://github.com/ParasiteMH/Parasite/issues) tracker to ensure that your issue has not already been submitted before making a new post (use the search bar on the Issues page)
* Verify the validity of your issue
* Be clear, concise and specific in your messages
* Keep conversations on-topic
* Be respectful toward everyone
* Take advantage of [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) -- it's awesome, and it makes your submission that much better! üòÑ
* Create a separate issue for each feature request/bug report (don't talk about multiple things in one issue)

### Don't
* Bump issues for the sole purpose of receiving a response (all issues are acknowledged)
* Argue unproductively in the comments
* Stray off-topic
* Use logical fallacies in arguments
* Recreate an issue you feel was unjustly closed -- if you feel an issue was unjustly closed, feel free to add a comment to the issue explaining why
* Add comments such as üëç, +1, or "I like this idea" -- use [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)!

## Submitting An Issue
<hr>

* Once you're ready to submit your bug report or feature request, head over to this [page]() to begin the process
* You can also comment on other issues and participate in other conversations. Remember, if you want to show support or general disagreement of an issue, use üëç and üëé reactions. You can also [sort issues by üëç reactions]() ([also by üëé if you'd like]())
